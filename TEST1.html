    <h3>Safety Guidelines</h3>
    
  <p>
             
    <b>Follow these guidelines to enhance your safety:</b>
    <!--br is a line break, these are used extensively throughout my work-->
    <br>
    <br>       
    ● Perform all routine and regular inspections specified in this manual.
    <br>
    ● Stop the engine and keep sparks and flames away before filling the fuel tank.
    <br>
    ● Do not run the engine in enclosed or partly enclosed areas. Carbon monoxide in exhaust gases 
    is toxic and can kill you.
    <br>
    <br>        
    <b>Always Wear a Helmet</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    It's a proven fact: helmets and protective apparel significantly reduce the number and severity 
    of head and other injuries. So always wear an approved helmet and protective apparel.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Before Riding</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Make sure that you are physically fit, mentally focused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check that you 
    and your passenger are both wearing an approved helmet and protective apparel. Instruct your passenger 
    on holding onto the seat strap or your waist, leaning with you in turns, and keeping their feet on the 
    footpegs, even when the vehicle is stopped.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Take Time to Learn & Practice</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Even if you have ridden other vehicles, practice riding in a safe area to become familiar with how this 
    vehicle works and handles, and to become accustomed to the vehicle's size and weight.
    We recommend that all riders take a certified course approved by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) or a 
    state approved training course. New riders should start with the basic course, and even experienced riders
    will find the advanced course beneficial. For information about the MSF training course nearest you, call the 
    national toll-free number:(800) 446-9227. Other riding tips can be found in the You and Your Motorcycle Riding 
    Tips booklet that came with your vehicle.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Ride Defensively</b>
    <br> 
    <br>
    Always pay attention to other vehicles around you, 
    and do not assume that other drivers seeyou. Be prepared to stop quickly or perform anevasive maneuver. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Make Yourself Easy to See</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Make yourself more visible, especially at night, by wearing bright reflective clothing, 
    positioning yourself so other drivers can see you, signaling before turning or changing lanes, and using your 
    horn when necessary.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Ride within Your Limits</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Never ride beyond your personal abilities or faster than conditions 
    warrant. Fatigue and inattention can impair your ability to use good judgment and ride safely.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Don't Drink or Use Drugs and Ride</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Alcohol or drugs and riding don't mix. Even one alcoholic drink can reduce your ability to respond to changing 
    conditions, and your reaction time gets worse with every additional drink. The same is true for drug use. Don't 
    drink or use and ride, and don't let your friends do it either. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Keep Your Honda in Safe Condition</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    It's important to keep your vehicle properly maintained and in safe riding condition. Inspect your vehicle before 
    every ride and perform all recommended maintenance. Never exceed load limits (2 P. 15), and do not modify your vehicle 
    or install accessories that would make your vehicle unsafe. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>If You are Involved in a Crash</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Personal safety is your first priority. If you oranyone else has been injured, take time to assess the severity of the 
    injuries and whether it is safe to continue riding. Call for emergency assistance if needed. Also follow applicable laws 
    and regulations if another person or vehicle is involved in the crash. If you decide to continue riding, first turn the 
    ignition switch to the OFF position, and evaluate the condition of your vehicle. Inspect for fluid leaks, check the tightness 
    of critical nuts and bolts, and check the handlebar, control levers, brakes, and wheels. Ride slowly and cautiously. Your vehicle 
    may have suffered damage that is not immediately apparent. Have your vehicle thoroughly checked at a qualified service facility as soon as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Carbon Monoxide Hazard</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas. Breathing carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness and may lead to death. 
    If you run the engine in confined or even partly enclosed area, the air you breathe could contain a dangerous amount of carbon monoxide. Never run your 
    vehicle inside a garage or other enclosure.
    <br> 
    <h1>WARNING</h1>
    <hr>
    <b>Running the engine of your vehicle while in an enclosed or even partially enclosed area can cause a rapid build-up of toxic carbon monoxide gas. 
    Breathing this colorless, odorless gas can quickly cause unconsciousness and lead to death. Only run your vehicle's engine when it is located in a well 
    ventilated area outdoors.</b>
    <hr>
    <!-- Page 11 Honda Shadow Manual (This is a reminder of what page I was on)-->
    <b>Safety Labels</b>
    Safety and information labels on your vehicle provide important safety information and may warn you of potential hazards that could cause serious injury. 
    Read these labels carefully and don't remove them. If a label comes off or becomes hard to read, contact your dealer for a replacement.

    <h3>Safety Precautions</h3>
    <br>
    ● Ride cautiously and keep your hands on the handlebar and feet on the footpegs.
    <br>
    ● Keep passenger's hands onto the seat strap or your waist, passenger's feet on the footpegs while riding.
    <br>
    ● Always consider the safety of your passenger, as well as other drivers and riders.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Protective Apparel</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Make sure that you and any passenger are wearing an approved helmet, eye protection, and high-visibility protective clothing. Avoid wearing loose clothes 
    that could get caught on any part of the vehicle. Ride defensively in response to weather and road conditions. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Helmet</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Should be safety-standard certified, high-visibility, and the correct size for your head. 
    <br>
    <br>
    ● Must fit comfortably but securely, with thechin strap fastened.
    <br>
    ● Face shield with unobstructed field of visionor other approved eye protection.
    <br>
    <br>
    Look for a DOT (Department of Transportation) certification label on any helmet you buy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>WARNING</h1>
    <hr>
    <b>Not wearing a helmet increases the chance of serious injury or death in a crash. Make sure that you and any passenger always wear an approved helmet and protective 
    apparel.</b>
    <hr>
    <br> 
    <b>Gloves</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Full-finger leather gloves with high abrasion resistance
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Boots or Riding Shoes</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sturdy boots with non-slip soles and ankle protection
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Jacket and Pants</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Protective, highly visible, long-sleeved jacket and durable long pants for riding (or aprotective suit)
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Riding Precautions</h3>
    <br>
    <b>Break-in Period</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    During the first 300 miles (500 km) of running, follow these guidelines to ensure your vehicle's future reliability and performance.
    <br>
    <br>
    ● Avoid full-throttle starts and rapid acceleration.
    <br>
    ● Avoid hard braking and rapid down-shifts.
    <br>
    ● Ride conservatively.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Brakes</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Observe the following guidelines:
    <br>
    <br>
    ● Avoid excessively hard braking and downshifting.
    <br>
    ● Sudden braking can reduce the vehicle's stability.
    <br>
    ● Where possible, reduce speed beforeturning; otherwise you risk sliding out.
    <br>
    ● Exercise caution on low traction surfaces.
    <br>
    ● The tires slip more easily on such surfaces and braking distances arelonger.
    <br>
    ● Avoid continuous braking.
    <br>
    ● Repeated braking, such as when descending long, steep slopes can seriously overheat the brakes, reducing their effectiveness. Use engine 
    braking with intermittent use of the brakes toreduce speed.
    <br>
    ● For full braking effectiveness, operate both the front and rear brakes together.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Combined ABS</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    VT750CS
    <br>
    <br>
    Your vehicle's rear brake system is linked to the front brake. This means that operating the rear brake pedal applies the rear brake and aportion 
    of the front brake. Operating the front brake lever applies only the front brake. For full braking effectiveness, operate both the front and rear brakes 
    together. This model is also equipped with an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) designed to help prevent the brakes from locking up during hard braking.
    <br>
    <br>
    ● ABS does not reduce braking distance. Incertain circumstances, ABS may result in alonger stopping distance.
    <br>
    ● ABS does not function at speeds below 6mph (10 km/h).
    <br>
    ● The brake lever and pedal may recoil slightly when applying the brakes. This is normal.
    <br>
    ● Always use the recommended tires to ensure correct ABS operation.
    <!--Starting on page 16 in the owner's manual-->
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Engine Braking</b>
    Engine braking helps slow your vehicle down when you release the throttle. For further slowing action, downshift to a lower gear. Use engine braking with 
    intermittent use of the brakes to reduce speed when descending long, steep slopes. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Wet or Rainy Conditions</b>
    Road surfaces are slippery when wet, and wet brakes further reduce braking efficiency. Exercise extra caution when braking in wet conditions. If the brakes get wet, 
    apply the brakes while riding at low speed to help them dry. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Parking</b>
    ● Park on a firm, level surface.
    <br>
    ● If you must park on a slight incline or loose surface, park so that the vehicle cannot move or fall over.
    <br>
    ● Make sure that high-temperature parts cannot come into contact with flammable materials.
    <br>
    ● Do not touch the engine, muffler, brakes and other high-temperature parts until they cool down.
    <br>
    ● To reduce the likelihood of theft, always lock the handlebar and remove the key when leaving the vehicle unattended. Use of an anti-theft device is also recommended.
    <!--Page 17-->
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Parking with the Side Stand</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Stop the engine.
    <br>
    2. Push the side stand down.
    <br>
    3. Slowly lean the vehicle to the left until its weight rests on the side stand.
    <br>
    4.Turn the handlebar fully to the left - <b>Turning the handlebar to the right reduces stability and may cause the vehicle to fall.</b>
    <br>
    5.Turn the ignition switch to the OFF position and remove the key.
    <br>
    6.Lock the steering. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Refueling and Fuel Guidelines</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Follow these guidelines to protect the engine, fuel system and catalytic converter:
    <br>
    ● Use only unleaded gasoline.
    <br>
    ● Use the recommended octane number. Using lower octane gasoline will result in decreased engine performance.
    <br>
    ● Do not use fuels containing a high concentration of alcohol.
    <br>
    ● Do not use stale or contaminated gasoline or an oil/gasoline mixture.
    <br>
    ● Avoid getting dirt or water in the fuel tank.
    <!--Page 18-->
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Accessories & Modification</b> 
    <br>
    <br>
    We strongly advise that you do not add any accessories that were not specifically designed or approved for your 
    vehicle by Honda or make modifications to your vehicle from its original design. Doing so can make it unsafe. 
    Modifying your vehicle may also void your warranty and make your vehicle illegal to operate on public roads. 
    Before deciding to install accessories on your vehicle, be certain the modification is safe and legal. 
    <h1>WARNING</h1>
    <hr>
    <b>Improper accessories or modifications can cause a crash in which you can be seriously hurt or killed. Follow all 
    instructions in this owner's manual regarding accessories and modifications.</b>
    <hr>
    <br>
    Do not pull a trailer with, or attach a sidecar to, your vehicle. Your vehicle was not designed for these attachments, 
    and their use can seriously impair your vehicle's handling.
    <br>
    <br>
    <!--Page 19-->
    <b>Loading</b>
    <br>
    ● Carrying extra weight affects your vehicle's handling, braking and stability. Always ride at a safe speed for the load you are carrying.
    <br>
    ● Avoid carrying an excessive load and keep within specified load limits. <!--Add maximum load limits?-->
    <br>
    ● Tie all luggage securely, evenly balanced, and close to the center of the vehicle.
    <br>
    ● Do not place objects near the lights or themuffler.
    <br>
    <br>

          Continuing to ride with low oil pressure can cause serious damage to the engine.
          <hr>
          1. Check the engine oil level, and add oil as necessary. 
          <br>
          2. Start the engine. Only continue riding if the low oil pressure indicator goes off.
          <br>
          <br>
          Rapid acceleration may momentarily cause the low oil pressure indicator to come on, especially if the oil is at or near the low level. If the low oil 
          pressure indicator stays on when the oil level is at the proper level, stop the engine and contact your dealer. If the engine oil level goes down rapidly, 
          your vehicle may have a leak or another serious problem. Have your vehicle inspected by your dealer.

          <br>
          ● Indicator does not go off at speeds above 6 mph (10 km/h). 
          <br>
          <br>
          If the ABS indicator stays on, your brakes will continue to work as a conventional system, but without the 
          anti-locking function. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The ABS indicator may flash if you turn the rear wheel while the rear wheel is lifted off the ground. In this case, turn the ignition switch to the OFF position, 
          and then to the ON position again. The ABS indicator will go off after your speed reaches 19 mph (30km/h).

          <b>Tube Repair and Replacement</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          If a tube is punctured or damaged, you should replace it as soon as possible. A tube that is repaired may not have the same reliability as a new one, and it may fail while 
          you are riding. If you need to make a temporary repair by patching a tube or using an aerosol sealant, ride cautiously at reduced speed and have the tube replaced before 
          you ride again. Anytime a tube is replaced, the tire should be carefully inspected as described.
          <br>

         <b>Ignition Key/Steering Lock Key</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Be sure to record the key number provided with the original keys. Store the spare key and key number in a safe location. To make a duplicate, take the spare key or the key 
         number to your dealer. If you lose all ignition keys and the key number, the ignition switch assembly will probably have to be removed by your dealer to determine the key 
         number. A metal key holder may cause damage to the area surrounding the ignition switch.

         <b>Ignition Switch</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Leaving the ignition switch in the ON position with the engine stopped will drain the battery. Do not turn the key while riding.
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Engine Stop Switch</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Do not use the engine stop switch except in an emergency. Doing so when riding will cause the engine to suddenly turn off, making riding unsafe. If you stop the engine 
         using the engine stop switch, turn the ignition switch to the OFF position. Failing to do so will drain the battery.

         <b>Caring for Your Vehicle</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Frequent cleaning and polishing is important to ensure the life of your Honda. A clean vehicle makes it easier to spot potential problems. In particular, seawater and 
         salts used to prevent ice on roads promote the formation of corrosion. Always wash your vehicle thoroughly after riding on coastal or treated roads. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Washing</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Allow the engine, muffler, brakes, and other high-temperature parts to cool before washing.
         <br>
         <br>
         1. Rinse your vehicle thoroughly using a low pressure garden hose to remove loose dirt.
         <br>
         2. If necessary, use a sponge or a soft towel with mild cleaner to remove road grime. Clean the headlight lens, panels, andother plastic components with extra care to 
         avoid scratching them. Avoid directing water into the air cleaner, muffler, and electrical parts.
         <br>
         3. Thoroughly rinse your vehicle with plenty of clean water and dry with a soft, clean cloth.
         <br>
         4. After the vehicle dries, lubricate any moving parts. Make sure that no lubricant spills onto the brakes or tires. Brake discs, pads, drum or shoes contaminated with oil 
         will suffer greatly reduced braking effectiveness and can lead to a crash.
         <br>
         5. Apply a coat of wax to prevent corrosion. Avoid products that contain harsh detergents or chemical solvents. These can damage the metal, paint, and plastic on your 
         vehicle. Keep the wax clear of the tires and brakes. If your vehicle has any matte painted parts, do not apply a coat of wax to the matte painted surface.
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Washing Precautions</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Follow these guidelines when washing:
         <br>
         ● Do not use high-pressure washers: High-pressure water cleaners can damage moving parts and electrical parts, rendering them inoperable. Water in the air intake can be 
         drawn into the throttle body and/or enter the air cleaner.
         <br>
         ● Do not direct water at the muffler: Water in the muffler can prevent starting and causes rust in the muffler.
         <br>
         ● Dry the brakes: Water adversely affects braking effectiveness. After washing, apply the brakes intermittently at low speed to help dry them.
         <br>
         ● Do not direct water under the seat: Water in the under seat compartment can damage your documents and other belongings.
         <br>
         ● Do not direct water at the air cleaner: Water in the air cleaner can prevent the engine from starting.
         <br>
         ● Do not direct water near the headlight: The headlight's inside lens may fog temporarily after washing or while riding in the rain. This does not impact the headlight 
         function. Any condensation inside the headlight should dissipate after a few minutes of running the engine with the headlight(s) on.However, if you see a large amount of 
         water or ice accumulated inside the lens(es), have your vehicle inspected by your dealer.
         <br>
         ●Do not use wax or polishing compounds on matte painted surfaces: Use a soft cloth or sponge, plenty of water, and a mild detergent to clean matte painted surfaces. 
         Dry with a soft clean cloth.
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Aluminum Components</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Aluminum will corrode from contact with dirt, mud, or road salt. Clean aluminum parts regularly and follow these guidelines to avoids cratches:
         <br>
         ● Do not use stiff brushes, steel wool, or cleaners containing abrasives.
         <br>
         ● Avoid riding over or scraping against curbs. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Panels</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         Follow these guidelines to prevent scratches and blemishes:
         <br>
         <br>
         ● Wash gently using a soft sponge and plenty of water.
         <br>
         ● To remove stubborn stains, use diluted detergent and rinse thoroughly with plenty of water.
         <br>
         ● Avoid getting gasoline, brake fluid, or detergents on the instruments, panels, or headlight. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Exhaust Pipe and Muffler</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         The exhaust pipe and muffler are stainless steel but may become stained by mud or dust. To remove mud or dust, use a wet sponge and a liquid kitchen abrasive, 
         then rinse well with clean water. Dry with chamois or a soft towel. If necessary, remove heat stains by using a commercially available fine texture compound. 
         Then, rinse by the same manner as removing mud or dust.
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>NOTICE</b>
         <hr>
         Even though the exhaust is made of stainless steel, it can become stained. Remove all marks and blemishes as soon as they are noticed.
         <hr>
         <b>Storing Your Vehicle</b>
         <br>
         <br>
         If you store your vehicle outdoors, you should consider using a full-body cover. If you won't be riding for an extended period, follow these guidelines:
         <br>
         <br>
         ● Wash your vehicle and wax all painted surfaces (except matte painted surfaces). Coat chrome pieces with rust-inhibiting oil.
         <br>
         ● Place your vehicle on a maintenance stand and position a block so that both tires are off the ground.
         <br>
         ● After rain, remove the body cover and allow the vehicle to dry.
         <br>
         ● Remove the battery to prevent discharge. Fully charge the battery and then place it in a shaded, well-ventilated area. If you leave the battery in place, disconnect the negative - terminal toprevent discharge. 
         <br>
         <br>
         After removing your vehicle from storage, inspect all maintenance items required by the Maintenance Schedule.

        <b>Recycle Wastes</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Put oil and other toxic wastes in approved containers and take them to a recycling center. Call your local or state office of public works or environmental services to 
        find a recycling center in your area and to get instructions on how to dispose of non-recyclable wastes. Do not place used engine oil in the trash or pour it down a drain 
        or on the ground. Used oil, gasoline, coolant, and cleaning solvents contain poisons that can hurt refuse workers and contaminate drinking water, lakes, rivers, and oceans.

        <b>Vehicle Identification Number</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The VIN and engine serial number uniquely identify your vehicle and are required in order to register your vehicle. They may also be required when ordering replacement 
        parts. You should record these numbers and keep them in a safe place.

        <b>Emission Control Systems</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Your vehicle engine emits combustion byproducts, including carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and hydrocarbons (HC). Gasoline evaporation also emits hydrocarbons. 
        Controlling the production of NOx, CO, and HC is important for the environment.
